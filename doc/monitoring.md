# Monitoring Stream-DNS

 The best way to ensure proper Stream-DNS performance and operation is by monitoring its key metrics in three broad areas:

* **DNS engine metrics** such as client connections and requests.
* **Consumer metrics** such as number of record got from your event source (ex: Kafka).
* **Resolver metrics** such as  number of queries to non-authoritative zone.

Correlating this metrics can gives you a more comprehensive view of your infrastructure and helps you quickly identify potential hotspots. Because you have to remember that DNS is key component in a network communication, as is the first thing to do to know where a node is located.

## DNS engine metrics

## Consumer metrics

| Name | Description | Metric Type |
